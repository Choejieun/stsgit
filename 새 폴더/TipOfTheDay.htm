How can I make XYplorer my default file manager?
In other words, how to associate XY with folders, so that every time Windows Explorer would be opened by some process, now XYplorer will be opened instead? 
It's simple, but it involves editing the registry, so take care. {Here|http://www.xyplorer.com/faq-topic.php?id=1} is the way.
#
How to quickly remove any filters
Address Bar: When pressing Enter on an empty pattern {XYplorer|http://www.xyplorer.com} will browse the {:current location}, removing any current {:Visual Filters|Visual Filter} or {:Name Search} patterns.

See also {Quick Name Search}, {How to set a Visual Filter}.
#
Quick Name Search
You may enter search patterns directly into the Address Bar and the "Go to" boxes: Simply put "?" between location and pattern.

Example: <span class=code>C:\WINDOWS\?*.log</span>
Finds all LOG files in C:\WINDOWS\
#
How to set a Visual Filter
Find the command "Set Visual Filter... (Ctrl+J)" in each tab header's {:context menu}.

Example: Set the VF to *.txt to only show files with the {:extension} TXT in the file list.
#
Toggle search filters
Find Files tabs: You can quickly enable/disable filters by right-clicking the tab headers, or by holding CTRL while left-clicking them.
#
Stop a search
You can stop an ongoing search at any time by pressing ESC (or using the Stop button in the Toolbar).
#
Save As
Press Ctrl+S (Copy Here As...) to quickly create a renamed copy of the focused {:item}.
#
Make a dated copy
Press Ctrl+Shift+D to quickly create a copy of the focused {:item} with its {:Modified Date} appended to the original filename.
#
Show/Hide the Info Panel
Left-click on the {:Statusbar} or press F12.
#
Size the Info Panel
There's a 3 pixel high splitter between {:Info Panel} and {:Statusbar}. Grab it with the mouse and move it up/down.
#
New Items
Read the Help about the fully portable and easily configurable <b>New Items</b> menu! It's a <b>Major time saver!</b>
#
Bring it back 
Use Ctrl+T followed by Alt+Left to bring back any accidentally closed tab. 
#
Swap paths 
Use F7 to swap between two recently used paths. 
#
Two ways of switching tabs
1. Use Ctrl+Tab (Ctrl+Shift+Tab) to go to next (previous) tab. 
2. Point mouse on any tab and use mouse-wheel switch tabs. 
#
Favorite folders
Right-click on empty space of Tree to see your favorite folders in a popup menu.

For a much more powerful approach to favorite folders and files check out the {Catalog}.
#
Catalog
A configurable and multi-functional favorites pane (Ctrl+F8) right below the Tree. The Catalog is an extremely powerful interface element that you should by all means try out in case you have not done so already! Consult the Help file for more information.
#
Customize keyboard shortcuts
Use Shift+F9 to customize your shortcut keys. 
#
Add/remove Toolbar icons
In the Customize Toolbar dialog: Simply double-click the icons. 
#
Customize the Toolbar
Use Ctr+Shift+F9 to customize the toolbar, i.e. decide which buttons are shown in what order.
#
Color the files
Tools/Configuration/Color Filters: Color your music files (e.g. mp3, ogg), work files (e.g. doc, ppt) or family pics (e.g. jpg, png) for easy location.
#
Too many confusing files around? 
Select any file extension(s) in the List and press Ctrl+Alt+J to see only those file extensions. Use Ctrl+Shift+J to go back to normal.
#
Quick selection
Use Ctrl+Alt+M on any file extension(s) and only those will get selected. 
#
Most Toolbar buttons have context menu
Right-clicking on most of the toolbar icons pops up context-specific options. 
#
Breadcrumbs 
Right-click on the tab header icon to get {:breadcrumb}s, or use Ctrl+Backspace.
#
Marking/Coloring the tree 
Right-click on any tree item and use "Mark" to highlight those items in various ways. 
#
Default tab
If you work with {:locked tabs} it is highly recommended to set one <i>unlocked</i> tab as "Default tab", in order to reduce the number of automatically opened tabs.
#
Tab with a Home
The idea of setting a Home for a tab is to be able to easily "Go Home" (Alt+Home), and so restoring the tab's {:mode|list modes}, location, columns order and sort order in one click.
#
Tab locked to a Home Zone
When you have a Home set for a tab, you can lock a tab to its Home Zone. What this means is, instead of being locked to a single location, the tab will be locked to its Home path and all its subfolders.
#
Avoid auto-scrolling
When dragging items out of the List, take the "right route", i.e. leave the list via its right part. Then it won't auto-scroll when you approach the margins.
#
Open a new tab
There are many ways:
- Menu View | Current Tab | Open New Tab (Ctrl+T).
- Right-click a tab header: Open New Tab.
- Dbl-click the grey space on the Tab bar.
- Hold SHIFT while opening a folder.
- There is also a toolbar button "New Tab".
#
Open folder in new tab
Almost everywhere in XYplorer, holding SHIFT while opening a folder will open it in a new foreground tab.
#
Quick image preview (full screen)
Hit F11 to quickly preview an image file full screen.

To show the filename and image size: Check Configuration | Preview | Full Screen Preview | Show Filename
#
Increase font
Hold control and scroll mouse to increase/decrease font size.
#
Move tabs
Point mouse over any tab and Shift+Scroll to move it.
#
Sorting the list, #1
Sort columns by clicking on the column headers. Reverse sort order by clicking again. 
#
Sorting the list, #2
Right-click the # column (Line Numbers) to get sort options. Handy if you want to sort by any column that is turned OFF.
#
Sorting the list, #3
Hold the CTRL key while clicking a column header to keep the focused item in view.
Or check "Keep focused item in view after sorting" (in Configuration | Advanced) to achieve the same without holding CTRL.
#
Autosize columns
Dbl-click the # column (Line Numbers).
#
Statusbar text
Double-click on any {:statusbar} text to copy it to clipboard. 
#
Properties tab
Double-click to copy any value or icon in {:Info Panel}'s Properties tab.
#
Size the Name column by keys
<div class=code>  "Grow Name Column"    (Ctrl+Shift+Numpad Add)
  "Shrink Name Column"  (Ctrl+Shift+Numpad Subtract)</div>
Works in Details, List, and Small Icons view!
#
Row heights
Use the mouse wheel to quickly change the row heights in for Tree, {:Catalog}, and List.
- Ctrl+Shift+MouseWheel Down: increase row height
